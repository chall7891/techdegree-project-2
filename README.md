# Pagination & Content Filter

A list of students and related information displayed through pagination and search functionality.

This project was done in conjunction with my TeamTreehouse full-stack JavaScript TechDegree, as the second project of twelve. Starter html and css files were provided for me. I was tasked with enhancing the usability of a web page that had too much information. The provided page included a list of 54 students with related pictures and information. I added pagination to display 10 of the 54 students per page, and added buttons to jump between the lists of 10 students. As extra credit, I programmed a search bar that produced student results in the same list format, but based on the search criteria.
